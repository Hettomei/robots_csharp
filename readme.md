It shows 200 robots finding bricks to move it in a given position

# What the mess in the source

I found old source code, so i put it on github.
It was a C# project, and right now I don't have a windows with visual studio in order to compile it and share a screenshot

I know source compile before put it on github, but it was in august 2012


# Why here

Maybe, some day, I will relaunch it
